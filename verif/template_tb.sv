     *  * Test for program completion and that a specific value has been written to a specific register.
        * Test on each cycle that certain signals match expected values (C1: f_pc == BASE_ADDR, C2: f_pc == BASE_ADDR + 32'd4...etc)
        * Test functionality: i.e., are you jumping/branching when you are expecting to, are you writing to the correct address (or byte of that address) in memory.
        * Test edge cases for branching, jumping, arithmetic, etc.
     * Below is ONE EXAMPLE of a test bench that is testing an arithmetic edge case.
     * This is just a skeleton to get you started and to give you some ideas, it is by no means exhaustive.

     * Sometimes you will need to compare an execution diagram to your waveforms, you might have the correct values but at the wrong time.
     * Plan and think about what should happen with your design, write pseudo code for your test bench, and learn to translate it to HDL.
